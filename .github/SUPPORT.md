# Support

Thanks for checking out **KK4TSS-Shack**. This repo is mainly my personal shack notes and scripts, but Iâ€™m happy to help point you in the right direction.

## ðŸ“¡ Where to Get Help

- **Issues**  
  If you find a bug in one of the scripts or spot something wrong in the notes, open an [Issue](../../issues).  
  Please keep it clear and simple â€” this isnâ€™t a huge project, just a collection of useful shack tools.

- **Pull Requests**  
  Got a fix or improvement? PRs are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

- **General Questions**  
  If itâ€™s ham radio related but not directly tied to this repo, your best bet is QRZ forums, local ham clubs, or ARRL resources. Iâ€™ll help if I can, but this repo isnâ€™t a full-blown help desk.

## â˜• Support the Project

If youâ€™ve found something here useful and want to say thanks, you can buy me a coffee.
