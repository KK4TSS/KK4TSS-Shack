# Contributing to KK4TSS-Shack

This repo is mostly my personal shack notes, but if you’ve got something useful to add, scripts, setup tips, quick reference docs, I’m open to pull requests.

Ground Rules
	•	Keep it simple and practical. If it doesn’t help someone actually run their station, it probably doesn’t belong here.
	•	No bloat. This isn’t a software framework — just notes, configs, and small utilities.
	•	Plain English (or plain shell). Fancy is fine, but clear and usable is better.

How to Contribute
	1.	Fork the repo
	2.	Make your change in a branch
	3.	Send a pull request with a short description of what you added and why

What I’m Looking For
	•	Handy shack scripts (updates, cleanup, quick tools)
	•	Setup/config guides for common ham radio software
	•	Band planning charts or reference cards
	•	Antenna sweep results or testing notes

What I’m Not Looking For
	•	Big dependency-heavy code projects
	•	Random unrelated scripts or docs
	•	Overly complex changes

Thanks for keeping it lightweight and useful.
73, KK4TSS (Chris)
