# US Amateur Radio — General-Class Quick Reference Rules & Watch-Outs

**Scope:** United States, FCC Part 97. Aimed at day-to-day operating.  
**Not legal advice.** Always verify against the current FCC rules and the ARRL band chart.

---

## At-a-Glance Checklist
- ✅ **Identify** with your call sign at least every **10 minutes** and at the **end** of a contact.
- ✅ **Use minimum power** needed for reliable comms (absolute max **1.5 kW PEP** where allowed).
- ✅ **Stay non-commercial** (no communications for pay/benefit except narrow teaching/club exceptions).
- ✅ **Keep it two-way** (no “broadcasting” or program production; **no music** except limited official relays).
- ✅ **Don’t obscure meaning** (no encryption/codes to hide content; specific exceptions exist for certain control links).
- ✅ **You’re responsible**: the **control operator** and the **licensee** share responsibility for lawful operation.
- ✅ **RF Exposure**: perform and keep an **RF safety evaluation**; re-evaluate when you change gear, power, or antennas.
- ✅ **Mind primary/secondary** allocations; where we’re **secondary**, we must not cause interference and must accept it.

## Band-Specific “Gotchas”

### 60 meters (5 MHz)
- **Channelized** operation on five USB channels (fixed centers).  
- **Power**: **100 W EIRP** limit (not transmitter output).  
- **Modes**: specific allowed modes only; follow current channel/mode notes.

### 30 meters (10.100–10.150 MHz)
- **No phone** (CW and data only).  
- **Power**: **200 W PEP** maximum.  
- Avoid interference to fixed services internationally.

### WARC Bands (30 / 17 / 12 m)
- By long-standing **convention**, these are **contest-free**. Great for casual DX during contest weekends.

### 630 m (472–479 kHz) and 2200 m (135.7–137.8 kHz)
- **Secondary** allocations with **strict EIRP limits**.  
- **One-time notification** to the **Utilities Technology Council** (via FCC process) is required **before** transmitting.

### 70 cm (420–450 MHz)
- Shared with federal services; **regional/power/geographic restrictions** exist in parts of the US. Check local notes.

## Your General-Class **Phone (SSB) Segments**
- **80 m:** 3.800–4.000 MHz  
- **40 m:** 7.175–7.300 MHz  
- **20 m:** 14.225–14.350 MHz  
- **17 m:** 18.110–18.168 MHz (all-mode)  
- **15 m:** 21.275–21.450 MHz  
- **12 m:** 24.930–24.990 MHz (all-mode)  
- **10 m:** 28.300–29.700 MHz (AM commonly 29.0–29.2; FM: 29.6 simplex / 29.5–29.7 repeaters)

> **Band-edge tip (SSB):** Your signal is ~2.7–3 kHz wide. Keep your **dial at least ~3 kHz inside** the band edge or sub-band edge (LSB below 10 MHz, USB above) so your emissions don’t spill over.

---

## Power, Emissions, and RF Safety
- **Maximum**: up to **1.5 kW PEP** where permitted; **use the minimum** necessary for reliable communication.
- **Special limits**: 30 m = **200 W PEP**; 60 m = **100 W EIRP** (pay attention to antenna gain and feedline losses).
- **Spurious emissions**: ensure your station is clean; use proper filtering and good engineering practice.
- **RF Exposure**: evaluate **MPE** for typical operating scenarios (duty cycle, modes, power, antenna gain, distance). Re-check after changes.

---

## Content Rules (Easy-to-Forget)
- **No commercial/pecuniary** communications.
- **No broadcasting**: the service is for **two-way** comms; no program production or “beaconing” voice/music.
- **No music** (narrow exceptions for official relays).
- **No encryption** to hide meaning; limited exceptions for some control links/space telecommand.
- **Third-party traffic**:  
  - Inside the US: you may let unlicensed people speak **under your control**.  
  - **International**: only with countries that have a third-party agreement. **Check the current list before you try.**

---

## Control & Emergencies
- **Control operator**: must ensure operation stays within privileges and rules; the station **licensee** also shares responsibility.
- **Emergency communications**: if there is immediate danger to life or property and normal comms are unavailable, you may use **any means** necessary.

---

## Digital & Data Notes
- **Modernization**: the old **HF symbol-rate limits were removed (2023)**; operation is now governed by **bandwidth-based** limits and existing sub-band/mode rules. Keep your signals narrow, identify properly, and avoid causing interference.
- **Automatic/remote**: follow control and identification rules; ensure your station can be **immediately** controlled as required.

---

## Good Operating Hygiene
- **Listen first**. Ask if the frequency is in use before calling CQ.  
- **Split & pileups**: understand how to work split to avoid transmitting out of band or into restricted segments.  
- **Logging**: not legally required in the US, but keeping a log helps with troubleshooting, QSLs, and interference inquiries.  
- **Phonetics**: use standard **ITU/ICAO** when conditions are rough.  
- **Courtesy**: we share spectrum globally—be a good neighbor.
