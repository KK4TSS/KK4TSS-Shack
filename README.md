# KK4TSS-Shack
Shack Setup &amp; Notes for my ham radio station (KK4TSS). This repository is a living notebook of my rigs, antennas, scripts, and setup guides.  

# Welcome
Welcome to my shack notes. This repo is where I park configs, scripts, and random experiments tied to my ham radio station KK4TSS. Nothing fancy â€” just the things I actually use day to day. If it helps another ham get on the air faster, then itâ€™s doing its job.

# Whatâ€™s in Here
	â€¢	Scripts â€“ quick Pi update, shack cleanup, unattended security updates.
	â€¢	Setup notes â€“ radio configs, WSJT-X, GridTracker, NetLogger quirks.
	â€¢	Band cheat sheets â€“ FT8/FT4 daily planning card and other printables.
	â€¢	Antenna testing â€“ RigExpert sweeps, TDR charts, and results.

# Why Bother
Because I hate re-doing the same work twice. This repo keeps my shack organized and might save another ham some headaches. Copy, fork, or ignore â€” totally up to you.
